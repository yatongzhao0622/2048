# Active Context

## Current Phase
OPTIMIZE - Level 3 Performance Optimization

## Project Status
- Complexity: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)
- Current Mode: OPTIMIZE
- Previous Mode: DOCUMENT
- Next Mode: REFLECT

## Implementation Status
âœ… Core Implementation Complete
- All modules implemented and tested
- Documentation complete
- Examples provided
- API stable and ready

## Performance Focus Areas
1. Core Operations
   - Board manipulation efficiency
   - State updates and immutability overhead
   - Random number generation performance
   - Memory allocation patterns

2. Critical Paths
   - Move operation optimization
   - Board state updates
   - Merge operations
   - New tile placement

3. Measurement Approach
   - Operation timing benchmarks
   - Memory usage profiling
   - State update performance
   - Comparative analysis with targets

## Optimization Strategy
1. Benchmarking Infrastructure
   - Set up performance measurement tools
   - Define baseline metrics
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Create reproducible test scenarios

2. Optimization Targets
   - Move operation < 1ms
   - Memory usage < 1MB per game
   - State updates < 0.5ms
   - New tile placement < 0.1ms

3. Trade-off Considerations
   - Immutability vs Performance
   - Type safety vs Runtime speed
   - Code clarity vs Optimization
   - Memory usage vs Speed

## Next Steps
1. Set up benchmarking infrastructure
2. Create baseline performance measurements
3. Profile critical operations
4. Implement and test optimizations
5. Document performance characteristics

## Quality Gates
- No regression in test coverage
- Maintain type safety
- Preserve immutability
- Keep code readability
- Document all optimizations
