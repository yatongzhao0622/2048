# Active Context

## Current Phase
PLAN - Level 3 Implementation Planning

## Project Status
- Complexity: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)
- Current Mode: PLAN
- Next Mode: IMPLEMENT

## Implementation Approach
1. Modular Development
   - Separate core logic from utilities
   - Clear module boundaries
   - Comprehensive testing per module

2. Functional Programming Principles
   - Immutable state management
   - Pure functions
   - Composition over inheritance

3. Quality Assurance
   - TypeScript strict mode
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Performance benchmarking

## Critical Paths
1. Core Data Structures
   - GameConfig & GameState integrity
   - Board operations efficiency
   - Random number generation reliability

2. State Management
   - Immutable state updates
   - Predictable state transitions
   - Performance optimization

## Next Steps
1. Initialize development environment
2. Implement core data structures
3. Develop game logic modules
